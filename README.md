Personal Website for all things me

This repo is formatted for Jekyll markdown framework to be used in this accounts [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). I used [this article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) to help me auto-generate the initial page, and I tweaked the code from there.
