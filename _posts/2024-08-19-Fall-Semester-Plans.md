## Plans for Fall 2024 Semester
With the start of the new semester I am most looking forward to refocusing on my career aspirations. I love working doing Machine/Deep learning and am going to apply to work in reasearch labs here at the College of Charleston. The first is doing object analysis for manufactured metal parts; so does this steel frame show signs of weakness. And the second is a Drone lab where the team uses the images from the drones as inputs for warehouse management.

## Classes

#### I am taking three Computer science focused classes:
- Algorithms and Data Structures: This class is a classic for CS students. I am looking forward to getting a better grasp of my options in solving niche problems in my day-to-day ML tasks.

- Database concepts: I will directly use this classes teachings to improve my understanding of handling data at a large(r) scale.

- Server-side web programming: Not too thrilled about not having a class being directly applicable to ML, but it is a required course and couldn't hurt.

#### My other two classes:

- Intermediate German: My school does require 2 years of a foreign language. I don't plan to do much with the language except order in German when I travel abroad, but doing hard things is good for me.

- Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence: I am most excited about this class; I can spread my wings (sort-of-speaking) and apply every topic to fuel my ML ambitions.


## Extracurriculars:

With what little free time I'll have left I plan too:

- Hit the gym

- Eat clean (yes, this does take effort and time out)

- read good books (currently reading Gulag Archipelago)
